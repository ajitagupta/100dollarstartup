If you are planning on going solo with a running business but don't know how to go about it then look no further. This book has all the instructions you require to get started and have something of value up and running in no time.

Small businesses aren't new but never before have so many possibilities come together in the right place at the right time: cheap and quick access to technology, instant market testing and easy money transfer using PayPal. The new reality is that working at a job may be the far riskier choice than working at a job. Hence, people pick to go out on their own to chart a safe course for themselves!

The author discusses results from case studies conducted over 100's of emails, skype calls, face-to-face discussions with 100+ entrepreneurs spread all over the world from the microbusiness lineage: self-employed ordinary people who started off without investment and employees, following their passion, creating profitable businesses (50k+ $ annual revenue) without any special (technical) skills. Examples:
* mattress selling plus bicycle delivery service
* yarn store
* teaching photography
* helping students quickly learn to speak other languages
* hand-crafted dresses and wedding accessories
* dog care
* bookkeeping

## Lesson 1: Where do Ideas Come From?
Wander around. You will spot opportunities everywhere! Some of them are:
* An inefficiency in the marketplace
* New technology (e.g mobile apps)
* A changing space
* A spin-off or side project (e.g. assistant, helper)
