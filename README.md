# Lessons from The $100 Startup
If you are planning on going solo with a business but don't know how to go about it then look no further. This book has all the instructions you require to get started and have something of value up and running.

Small businesses aren't new but never before have so many possibilities come together in the right place at the right time: cheap and quick access to technology, instant market testing and easy money transfer using PayPal. The new reality is that working at a job may be the far riskier choice than owning a business. Hence, people pick to strike out on their own!

The author discusses results from case studies conducted over 100's of emails, skype calls, face-to-face discussions with 100+ entrepreneurs spread all over the world from the microbusiness lineage: self-employed ordinary people who started off without outside investment (initial investment: <100$) and employees, following their passion, creating profitable businesses (50k+ $ annual revenue) without any special (technical) skills. Examples:
* mattress selling plus bicycle delivery service
* yarn store
* photography instructor
* helping students quickly learn to speak other languages
* hand-crafted custom dresses and wedding accessories
* dog care
* bookkeeping

He also lays out the raw material in a straightforward and comprehensive plan, lesson after lesson. 

## Lesson 1: Where do Ideas Come From?
Wander around. You will spot opportunities everywhere! Some of them are:
* An inefficiency in the marketplace
* New technology (e.g. mobile apps)
* A changing space
* A spin-off or side project (e.g. assistant)

The basic idea is to provide value of some kind by offering benefits, mainly to help people.

## Lesson 2: Six Steps to Getting Started Right Now
You don't need huge amounts of capital or training to get started. For microbusiness this is the usual process:
1. Decide on the product or service
2. Set up a basic website (e.g. through Wix, WordPress)
3. Develop an offer
4. Find a way to get paid (e.g. through PayPal)
5. Announce the offer
6. Learn from steps 1-5. Repeat.

Home in on what customers **really** want than what they need or less of what they dislike. Frequent wants are happiness, love, money, acceptance and free time. Frequent displeasures are stress, conflict, hassle, uncertainty, anxiety, debt.

## Lesson 3: Passion plus good business sense creates an actual business
Passion plus skill leads to finding a problem in the marketplace which is called opportunity. Pick something specific and price yourself appropriately. Ideally, get paid to pursue a hobby or something indirectly related to it. It's much easier to get paid for something that comes to you naturally. For some, however, the hobby might act as a stress reliever which they do not wish to combine with everyday work. Here's a checklist to be on the safer side of things:
* Would you enjoy pursuing your hobby 20+ hours a week?
* Do you enjoy teaching the hobby to others?
* Do you like the ins and outs of your hobby?
* Would you enjoy the hobby despite of administrative work?

Secondly, you must also find a space in the marketplace before execution. Has anyone asked you for help? Are people willing to pay for your expertise? And thirdly, how does the competition look like - can you locate a niche for your service?

## Lesson 4: There is more than one road to the road
Location is overrated - it is perfectly okay to practice independently of location. Because of the nature of work many business models such as music teacher, photographer, developer (e.g. website themes) and information publishing (e.g. a photography forum, ProBlogger) follow this path and build significant businesses (six figures+).

## Lesson 5: The Customer
Who are your people? As you explore different avenues it helps to think clearly about the people you intend to serve. They can either be grouped in terms of traditional demographics (age, location, gender, ethnicity, income) OR so-called new demographics: interests, passions, skills, beliefs and values.

While toying with ideas, an efficient way of finding the best solution is to simply ask your prospects, e.g. through a survey tool: What is your biggest problem with X? What is the number one question you have about X? What can I do to help you with X? Next, you can level up the process by asking about **specific** product ideas. Develop a significant (not simply *different*) solution. Ascertain that there is a demand for your offering before creating it.

## Lesson 6: Four Steps to Instant Market Testing
There's no harm in planning but getting started could take you forever. Instead, start immediately. Here is a plan of action:
* Make sure the market is big enough
* Focus on selling to people who know (invitation) rather than persuading them that they have a problem (pitch)
* Ask your potential target market for their opinion
* Test on a subgroup first in exchange for feedback and confidentiality

Keep initial costs down. Get your first sale as soon as possible. Respond to initial results. To avoid overcomplication describe your business in a 140-character mission statement.

## Lesson 7: Create a Compelling Offer
The difference between an ordinary offer and a great one is urgency. Make your customers act *now*! Provide them with the following:
* A FAQ (proactive response to generic and specific objections a customer might have)
* satisfaction guarantee
* overdelivery (e.g. a surprise)

## Lesson 8: Product Launch Checklist
A checklist can serve as a template for a new business launch as well as an idea generator for existing businesses.
* The big picture: Ensure there exists a clear value proposition. Build anticipation and excitement. Publish the time and date of launch in advance. Make the launch fun.
* Next steps: Test setup and order process. Review order page and important communications (e.g. launch message, sales page, ads).
* Money matters: Define success in numbers (net income, sales). Add a second payment option as backup. Create a payment plan for high-priced products.
* The night before: Prune inbox. Draft a meaningful launch message. Prepare blog and social media posts.
* The big morning: Soft launch at least 10 min early to make sure everything is working. Send out personal thankyou messages to first few buyers.
* Promotion: Ask for referrals. Write to affiliates, journalists and media contacts. Post on social networks.
* Follow-up (done in advance): general thankyou message, content for future communication
* Going above and beyond: postcards, calls, additional deliverables, unadvertised benefit
* Second-to-last step: C-e-l-e-b-r-a-t-e
* Very last step: start planning the next launch (how can you help more?)

## Lesson 9: Hustling
Maintain it a habit to connect with people 50% of your time as you create your business.
* Daily: Build up a social media presence with regular posts. Monitor key metrics.
* Weekly: Promote jointy with colleagues. Maintain communication with prospects.
* At least monthly: Make sure customers are happy. Prepare for events, giveaways, contests or product launches.
* From time to time: Perform business audit. Identify missing opportunities and turn them into significant projects.

In the beginning focus on saying yes to requests unless there is a good reason to decline them. Become selective as the business grows.

## Lesson 10: The Money
It's fantastic to have a beautiful website, popular blogs and many followers on social media but the ultimate goal of a business is to make money. Thus, it is important to channelize your efforts on making money early on. In short, follow these three principles:
1. Price should be based on benefits, not costs for creating or manufacturing
2. Offer a range of prices (ask about *which* rather than *if*)
3. Get paid more than once for the same thing

You have more money and access to help than you think. Be creative about finding what you need!

## Lesson 11: Increasing Income
Moving on up by increasing income in an existing business is generally easier than starting a new business. There are two ways to grow a business:
1) Horizontal expansion: serving more customers with different related interests
2) Vertical expansion refers to going deeper by addressing the same customers with different levels of need.

## Lesson 12: Leverage
A business can be strategically grown using franchising. You can split your audience into two groups and either reach more people with the same message or different people with a new message. Here are different ways to franchise yourself:
1) Virtual Assistants
2) Partnership
3) Outsourcing
4) Affiliate Programs
