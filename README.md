# The $100 Startup
If you are planning on going solo with a business but don't know how to go about it then look no further. This book has all the instructions you require to get started and have something of value up and running.

Small businesses aren't new but never before have so many possibilities come together in the right place at the right time: cheap and quick access to technology, instant market testing and easy money transfer using PayPal. The new reality is that owning a business may be the far riskier choice than working at a job. Hence, people pick to strike out on their own!

The author discusses results from case studies conducted over 100's of emails, skype calls, face-to-face discussions with 100+ entrepreneurs spread all over the world from the microbusiness lineage: self-employed ordinary people who started off without investment and employees, following their passion, creating profitable businesses (50k+ $ annual revenue) without any special (technical) skills. Examples:
* mattress selling plus bicycle delivery service
* yarn store
* photography instructor
* helping students quickly learn to speak other languages
* hand-crafted custom dresses and wedding accessories
* dog care
* bookkeeping

## Lesson 1: Where do Ideas Come From?
Wander around. You will spot opportunities everywhere! Some of them are:
* An inefficiency in the marketplace
* New technology (e.g mobile apps)
* A changing space
* A spin-off or side project (e.g. assistant)

The basic idea is to provide value of some kind by offering benefits, mainly to help people.

## Lesson 2: Six Steps to Getting Started Right Now
You don't need huge amounts of capital or training to get started. For microbusiness this is the usual process:
* Decide on the product or service
* Set up a basic website (e.g. through Wix, WordPress)
* Develop an offer
* Find a way to get paid (e.g. through PayPal)
* Announce the offer

Home in on what customers **really** want than what they need or less of what they dislike. Frequent wants are happiness, love, money, acceptance and free time. Frequent displeasures are stress, conflict, hassle, uncertainty, anxiety, debt.

## Lesson 3: Passion plus good business sense creates an actual business
Passion plus skill leads to finding a problem in the marketplace which is called opportunity. Pick something specific and price yourself appropriately. Ideally, get paid to pursue a hobby or something indirectly related to it. It's much easier to get paid for something that comes to you naturally. For some, however, the hobby might act as a stress reliever which they do not wish to combine with everyday work. Here's a checklist to be on the safer side of things:
* Would you enjoy pursuing your hobby 20+ hours a week?
* Do you enjoy teaching the hobby to others?
* Do you like the ins and outs of your hobby?
* Would you enjoy the hobby despite of administrative work?

Secondly, you must also find a space in the marketplace before execution. Has anyone asked you for help? Are people willing to pay for your expertise? And thirdly, how does the competition look like - can you locate a niche for your service?

## Lesson 4: There is more than one road to the road
Location is overrated - it is perfectly okay to practice independently of location. Because of the nature of work many business models such as music teacher, photographer, developer (e.g. website themes) and information publishing (e.g. a photography forum, hub for digital publishing) follow this path and build significant businesses (six figures+).

## Lesson 5: The Customer
Who are your people? As you explore different avenues it helps to think clearly about the people you intend to serve. They can either be grouped in terms of traditional demographics (age, location, gender, ethnicity, income) OR so-called new demographics: interests, passions, skills, beliefs and values.

While toying with ideas, an efficient way of finding the best solution is to simply ask your prospects, e.g. through a survey tool: What is your biggest problem with X? What is the number one question you have about X? What can I do to help you with X? Next, you can level up the process by asking about **specific** product ideas.

## Lesson 6: Seven Steps to Instant Market Testing
There's no harm in planning but getting started could take you forever. Instead, start immediately. Here's a plan of action:
* Care about the problem you are about to solve
* Make sure the market is big enough
* Focus on selling to people who know (invitation) rather than persuading them that they have a problem (pitch)c 
* Focus on reducing pain or fulfilling a deep desire
* Develop a significant (not simply *different*) solution
* Ask your potential target market for their opinion
* Test on a subgroup in exchange for feedback

Keep initial costs down. Get your first sale as soon as possible. Ascertain that there is a demand for your offering before creating it. Respond to initial results, e.g. through automation. To avoid overcomplication describe your business in a 140-character mission statement.

## Lesson 7: Create a Compelling Offer
The difference between an ordinary offer and a great one is urgency. Make your customers act *now*! Provide them with the following:
* A FAQ (proactive response to generic and specific objections a customer might have)
* satisfaction guarantee
* overdelivering
