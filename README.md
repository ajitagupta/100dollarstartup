# The $100 Startup
If you are planning on going solo with a running business but don't know how to go about it then look no further. This book has all the instructions you require to get started and have something of value up and running in no time.

Small businesses aren't new but never before have so many possibilities come together in the right place at the right time: cheap and quick access to technology, instant market testing and easy money transfer using PayPal. The new reality is that working at a job may be the far riskier choice than working at a job. Hence, people pick to go out on their own to chart a safe course for themselves!

The author discusses results from case studies conducted over 100's of emails, skype calls, face-to-face discussions with 100+ entrepreneurs spread all over the world from the microbusiness lineage: self-employed ordinary people who started off without investment and employees, following their passion, creating profitable businesses (50k+ $ annual revenue) without any special (technical) skills. Examples:
* mattress selling plus bicycle delivery service
* yarn store
* teaching photography
* helping students quickly learn to speak other languages
* hand-crafted dresses and wedding accessories
* dog care
* bookkeeping

## Lesson 1: Where do Ideas Come From?
Wander around. You will spot opportunities everywhere! Some of them are:
* An inefficiency in the marketplace
* New technology (e.g mobile apps)
* A changing space
* A spin-off or side project (e.g. assistant)

The basic idea is to provide value of some kind by offering benefits, mainly to help people.

## Lesson 2: Six Steps to Getting Stared Right Now
You don't need huge amounts of capital or focussed training to get started. For microbusiness this is the usual process:
* Decide on the product or service
* Set up a basic website (e.g. through Wix, WordPress)
* Develop an offer
* Find a way to get paid (e.g. through PayPal)
* Announce the offer

Home in on what customers **really** want than what they need or less of what they dislike. Frequent wants are happiness, love, money, acceptance and free time. Frequent displeasures are stress, conflict, hassle, uncertainty, anxiety, debt.

## Lesson 3: Passion plus good business sense creates an actual business
Passion plus skill leads to finding a problem in the marketplace which is called opportunity. Pick something specific and price yourself appropriately. Ideally, get paid to pursue a hobby or something indirectly related to it. It's much easier to get paid for something that comes to you naturally. For some, however, the hobby might act as a stress reliever which they do not wish to combine with everyday work. Here's a checklist to be on the safer side of things:
* Would you enjoy pursuing your hobby 20+ hours a week?
* Do you enjoy teaching the hobby to others?
* Do you like the ins and outs of your hobby?
* Would you enjoy the hobby despite of administrative work?

Secondly, you must also find a space in the marketplace before execution. Has anyone asked you for help? Are people willing to pay for your expertise? And thirdly, how does the competition look like - can you locate a niche for your service?

## Lesson 4: There is more than one road to the road
Location is overrated - it is perfectly okay to practice independently of location. Because of the nature of work many business models such as music teacher, photographer, developer (e.g. website themes) and information publishing (e.g. a photography forum, hub for digital publishing) follow this path.
